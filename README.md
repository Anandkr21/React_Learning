# React Basics - Getting Started Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to help you get started with React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Whether you are a beginner or have some prior experience with web development, this guide will walk you through the basics of React and help you set up your development environment.

## Installation

To get started with React, you need to set up your development environment. Follow these steps to install the necessary tools:

1. **Node.js and npm**: React requires Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) to be installed on your machine. Visit the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org) and download the latest LTS (Long Term Support) version suitable for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions provided.

2. **Create React App**: Once you have Node.js and npm installed, open your terminal (or command prompt) and run the following command to install Create React App globally:

```
npm install -g create-react-app
```

Creating a global installation of Create React App allows you to create new React applications easily.

## Creating a React Application

Now that you have installed Create React App, follow these steps to create your first React application:

1. Open your terminal (or command prompt) and navigate to the directory where you want to create your React application.

2. Run the following command to create a new React application named "my-react-app" (you can replace "my-react-app" with the desired name of your application):

```
npx create-react-app my-react-app
```

3. Once the command finishes executing, navigate to the newly created directory:

```
cd my-react-app
```

4. To start your React application, run the following command:

```
npm start
```

5. Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000. You should see the default React application running.

Congratulations! You have successfully created and started your first React application.

## Components and JSX

React applications are built using reusable components. Components are the building blocks of a React application and can be thought of as independent, self-contained pieces of the user interface.

React uses JSX (JavaScript XML) syntax, which allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript files. JSX makes it easier to describe the structure and appearance of your components.

## Props

In React, props (short for properties) are used to pass data from a parent component to its child components. Props are immutable and are used to configure and customize components based on their intended usage.

## State

State is another important concept in React. Unlike props, which are passed down from parent components, state is managed internally within a component. State represents the data that can change over time and affects how the component behaves and renders.

## Handling Events

React components can respond to user interactions through event handling. Events such as clicking a button, submitting a form, or hovering over an element can trigger specific actions in your application. React provides a straightforward way to handle these events and update the component's state or trigger other functions.

## Lifecycle Methods

React components have a lifecycle, meaning they go through different stages from initialization to destruction. These stages provide opportunities to perform specific actions at different points in a component's existence. React provides several lifecycle methods that allow you to hook into

the component's lifecycle and perform tasks like initialization, updating, and cleanup.

## React Router

React Router is a popular library that enables routing in React applications. It allows you to create multiple pages or views in your application and handle navigation between them. React Router helps in building single-page applications with multiple routes and provides a seamless user experience.

To learn more about React Router, refer to the official documentation: [React Router Documentation](https://reactrouter.com/)

## Additional Resources

Here are some additional resources to help you further explore and deepen your understanding of React:
